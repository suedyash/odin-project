# Knights Travails | Graph

- A project from [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-knights-travails).

## What I learned...

- Create a graph data structure capable of traversing the data.
- Implement Graph Traversal Algorithms in order to find the shortest route between two nodes.
- Better understand the applications of Graph.
