# Binary Search Tree

- A project from [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-binary-search-trees).

## What I learned

- Create a balanced binary search tree data structure that is capable of storing, retrieving, deleting, and traversing the data.
- Implement the level-order, pre-order, in-order, and post-order binary search tree traversal algorithms.
- Deepen the understanding and application of recursion.
