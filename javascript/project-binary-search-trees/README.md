# Binary Search Tree

- A project from [The Odin Project curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-binary-search-trees).

## What I learned...

- Create a balanced binary search tree data structure capable of storing, deleting, retrieving, and traversing the data.
- Implement Depth-First-Search Traversal Algorithms (pre-order, in-order, and post-order) and Breadth-First-Search Traversal Algorithm (level-order).
- Better understand the applications of recursion.
