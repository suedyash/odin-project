// A Binary Search Tree (also called an ordered or sorted binary tree), is a rooted binary tree data structure with the key of each internal node
// being greater than all the keys in the respective node's left subtree and less than the ones in its right subtree.
// A BST allows fast operations for lookup, insertion, and deletion of data items.
// Time Complexity of BST algorithms is => 0(n) time

// Balanced Binary Search Tree //
// It is a type of binary tree in which the difference between the height of the left and the right subtree for each node is either 0 or 1.
// To check if a binary tree is balanced we need to check three conditions:
// 1. The absolute difference between the heights of left and right subtress at any node should be less than 1.
// 2. For each node, its left subtree should be a balanced tree.
// 3. For each node, its right subtree should be a balanced tree.
